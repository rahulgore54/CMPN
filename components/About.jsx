                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications that connect with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.</p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>I started web development in 2020 and by far the journey has been amazing. I got to learn lot of new skills and technologies. Through my previous internship, I got to connect with other like-minded developers and the opportunity to work as a team. I am also highly involved in various open-source collaborations like Hacktoberfest and Google LTE fest.</p>
